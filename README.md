## Program.cs Description

The Program.cs file is the entry point for a Blazor WebAssembly application. It configures the root components, sets up services, configures Fluxor for state management, and sets the logging configuration. Finally, it builds and runs the application asynchronously. This file ensures that the application is properly initialized and configured before it starts running.

Key Components:
1. Root Components
2. Service Configuration
3. Fluxor Configuration
4. Logging Configuration
5. Application Initialization
6. Description of Visible Code
7. Root Components

The root components of the Blazor application are added to the component tree. These components are the entry points for the application and are rendered in the specified HTML elements.

```C
builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
builder.RootComponents.Add<HeadOutlet>("head::after");
```
* App: The main application component, rendered in the HTML element with the ID app.

* HeadOutlet: A component for rendering content in the HTML <head> element, rendered after the existing content.


Service Configuration
Services are configured and added to the dependency injection container. These services can be injected into components and other services throughout the application.

```C#
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });
builder.Services.AddScoped<FetchService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<AuthenticationTocken>();
```

* HttpClient: Configured with the base address of the host environment.
* FetchService: A custom service for handling HTTP requests.
* AuthenticationTocken: A custom service for managing authentication tokens.


Fluxor Configuration
Fluxor, a state management library for Blazor, is configured and added to the services.
```C#
builder.Services.AddFluxor(o =>
{
    o.ScanAssemblies(typeof(Program).Assembly);
    o.UseReduxDevTools();
});
```

* ScanAssemblies: Scans the specified assembly for Fluxor-related classes (e.g., actions, reducers, effects).
* UseReduxDevTools: Enables Redux DevTools integration for state debugging.


Logging Configuration
The logging configuration is set to a minimum level of Information.
```C#
builder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Information);
```
Application Initialization
The application is built and run asynchronously.

```C#
await builder.Build().RunAsync();
```

## Method

### LoginAsync

This method handles user login by sending a POST request with the login model and returns a token.

```C#
public async Task<JsonModel> LoginAsync(LoginModel loginModel)
{
    var response = await _httpClinet.PostAsJsonAsync($"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/creare-cont", loginModel);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    var token = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<JsonModel>();
    return token;
}
```
### SignUpAsync
This method handles user sign-up by sending a POST request with the sign-up model and returns a response model.

```C#
public async Task<SignUpResponseModel> SignUpAsync(SignUpModel signUpModel)
{
    var response = await _httpClinet.PostAsJsonAsync($"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/inregistrare", signUpModel);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    var result = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<SignUpResponseModel>();
    return result;
}
```

## Additional Methods like

### GetUserProfileAsync

This method retrieves the user's profile by sending a GET request.
```C#
public async Task<UserProfileModel> GetUserProfileAsync(string token)
{
    var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, $"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/profil");
    request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);

    return await _httpClinet.SendAsync(request);
}
```
The FetchService class provides a comprehensive set of methods for handling user authentication and profile management. These methods include logging in, signing up, retrieving user profiles, updating profiles, and logging out. Each method is designed to perform specific tasks by making appropriate HTTP requests or interacting with JavaScript, ensuring a clean and reusable service layer within the Blazor WebAssembly application.


## State management

The state management in this code is implemented using the Fluxor library, which is a state management library for Blazor applications. The code defines reducers that handle specific actions to update the application's state.


Let's focus on the ProfileCardState and how is used in the context of state management with Fluxor.

### ProfileCardState
The ProfileCardState likely represents the state of a user's profile card in the application. This state could include information such as the user's profile details, loading status, and any errors.

Description
ProfileCardState Definition:

The ProfileCardState class is defined in the State.cs file. It includes properties like HomeAddress, Country, County, Occupation, FullName, Email, Image, and various social media links.
```C#
public class ProfileCardState
{
    public string HomeAddress { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
    public string County { get; set; }
    public string Occupation { get; set; }
    public string FullName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public byte[] Image { get; set; }
    public string LinkedIn { get; set; }
    public string FaceBook { get; set; }
    public string GitHub { get; set; }
    public string Instagram { get; set; }
    public string Twitter { get; set; }
    public string Youtube { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }

    public ProfileCardState(string homeAddress, string country, string county, string occupation, string fullname, string email, byte[] image, string linkedIn, string faceBook, string gitHub, string instagram, string twitter, string youtube, string description)
    {
        HomeAddress = homeAddress;
        Country = country;
        County = county;
        Occupation = occupation;
        Image = image;
        FullName = fullname;
        Email = email;
        LinkedIn = linkedIn;
        FaceBook = faceBook;
        GitHub = gitHub;
        Instagram = instagram;
        Twitter = twitter;
        Youtube = youtube;
        Description = description;
    }

    public ProfileCardState() { }
}
```


It has constructors to initialize these properties, including a parameterless constructor for flexibility.


Feature Initialization:

The ProfileCardFeature class, defined in the Feature.cs file, specifies the initial state of ProfileCardState with default values.

```C#
using Fluxor;

namespace Checker.state
{
    public class ProfileCardFeature : Feature<ProfileCardState>
    {
        public override string GetName() => "ProfileCard";

        protected override ProfileCardState GetInitialState() =>
            new ProfileCardState(
                string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, new byte[0], 
                string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, 
                string.Empty
            );
    }
}
```

Reducers:

The ProfileCardReducer class, found in the Reducers.cs file, handles state changes. The ReduceProfileCard method updates the state based on the GetProfileCardState action by creating a new ProfileCardState with updated values.
```C#
using Fluxor;

namespace Checker.state
{
    public static class ProfileCardReducer
    {
        [ReducerMethod]
        public static ProfileCardState ReduceProfileCard(ProfileCardState state, GetProfileCardState action)
        {
            return new ProfileCardState(
                action.State.HomeAddress,
                action.State.Country,
                action.State.County,
                action.State.Occupation,
                action.State.FullName,
                action.State.Email,            
                action.State.Image,
                action.State.LinkedIn,
                action.State.FaceBook,
                action.State.GitHub,
                action.State.Instagram,
                action.State.Twitter,
                action.State.Youtube,
                action.State.Description
            );
        }
    }
}
```



Usage in Components:

In various Razor components like ProfileRender.razor, HomeRender.razor, and AdminRender.razor, the ProfileCardState is injected and used to display profile information.
These components fetch user data from the server and dispatch actions to update the state. For example, when the profile page is loaded, it checks the authentication token and fetches the user's profile data to update the state.

```C#
@page "/profile"

@using Checker.Pages.Message
@using global::Checker.state
@using global::Checker.Models 
@using global::Checker.Services
@using global::Checker.features
@using Fluxor
@inject AuthenticationTocken authenticationtocken
@inject IState<ProfileCardState> ProfileCardState

@inject FetchService fetchService
@inject IDispatcher Dispatcher

@if(error == false){
    @if(isLoading){
        <BlazorChecking/>
    } else if(tokenState){
        <ProfileDom/>
    }else{
        <Restricted/>
    }
}else{
    <BlazorError/>
}

@code{
    bool isLoading = true;
    bool error = false;
    bool tokenState;
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        tokenState = await authenticationtocken.Check();
        
        if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(ProfileCardState.Value.FullName)){
            isLoading = false;
            return;
        }

        string tokenString = await authenticationtocken.GetTocken();
        if(tokenState){
            try{
                var response = await fetchService.GetResponsSocialCard($"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/get", tokenString);
                Dispatcher.Dispatch(new GetProfileCardState(response));
                if(response != null){
                    isLoading = false;
                }else{
                    throw new Exception("eroare");
                }
            } catch (Exception) {
                error = true;
                return;
            }
        }else{
            isLoading = false;
        }
    }
}
```
This setup ensures consistent management and updating of the profile information across the application using Fluxor.
